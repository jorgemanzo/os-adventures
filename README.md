## Making a kernel from ground up

I really like low-level OS and kernel stuff, so I am learning more about it. I am following [this](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) guide, however I am leaving more comments about my understanding throught the progress.

Things I am specifically looking to learn about that books seem to skip:
- Creating the boot sector from scratch
- Going from real mode to protected mode
- Starting in Assembly and moving into C
- Virtualizing memory by creating page table data structures
- Handling faults and interrupts
- Loading binaries and executing them
- Anythign else I can get my hands on
